# DIME Writing Test

## List of the parts of the writing text

The test are composed of two parts. One part where the test taker shows their ability to review and provide feedback on text and one part where the test taker writes a short technical article based on material sent to them.

### 1. - Reviewing existing documentation and providing feedback
The test taker will be asked to look at the help files in *ietoolkit*. The exercise will then be to find some part of the documentation that can be improved and express why there is room for improvement.
* The purpose of this test is for the test taker to show that they can express the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.
    * Test takers should find parts of the *ietoolkit* documentation that they think can be difficult to understand for a typical user, and explain why they think that part will be difficult to understand
    * Test takers can make suggestions for how to improve the documentation as a way to explain why it needs to be improved, but we are more interested in *why* the test takers think it can be improved rather than *how* it can be improved.
    * The test is not about picking the part of the documentation in most need of improvement, it is about the test takers ability to discuss the topic of good and bad documentation
* The improvements can relate to anything in the list below. Multiple things to improve can be suggested if the test taker have time to do so.
    * Typos, broken links, broken formatting etc.
    * Unnecessary usage of advanced or technical terms, or lack or explanation when using such terms can't be avoided
    * Unnecessarily complicated way of describing something
    * Something that is missing or too briefly explained
    * Too much previous knowledge is required to understand something

### 2. - Write documentation from a draft
Assumptions for this test:
* The test taker should not be required to research a topic as that will take too long time, and that is usually not the case for a typical intern task.
* Provide a template with an unformatted structure that will help the test taker get started.

The test:
* Write a short article in markdown format on how to do a replicable randomization in Stata
    * Take the randomization presentation from track 1 in the FC training. Have the intern take the information in that presentation and make it into a short text. This topic and this presentation is selected because of the following reasons:
        * Relevant topic
        * The presentation is very informative but the explanations use graphs, so the test taker will need to come up with how to explain the same thing in text.
        * Topic that is both theoretical and code practical. A great submission can include text that is highlighted with code snippets.
* I have prepared a very rough template [here](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/writing-test/blob/master/part2-template.md).
    * Click the button that says `raw`
    * Copy the text from the _raw_ page into any code editor or text editor of your choice
        * Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac or search _markdown compiler_ on the internet (link to one example below)
